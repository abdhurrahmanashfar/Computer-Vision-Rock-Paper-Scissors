# Computer Vision RPS

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

### Milestone_2
Using Teachable Machines, I have created an image project model with four classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and None. In a future milestone, I will use this model to receive user input from the camera.

### Milestone_4 - manual_rps.py
The manual_rps.py file contains the code to play the rock paper scissors game, with the user typing "rock", "paper" or "scissors". The computer chooses one of the words at random. The user-selected word is compared with the computer-selected word to determine whether the user or computer has won the game.
